def bond_price(FV, c, T, rate, freq=4, t=0, freq2=0, **opt):
    r"""
    Returns the price of a bond given the zero-rates or a yield
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    `FV` : face value of the bond (float/int).
    
    `c`  : coupon rate (expressed in numbers between 0 and 1) 
    
    `T`  : time to maturity (expressed in years) 
    
    `rate`  : can be a single float number or a tuple containing maturities and  
            zero rates 
    
    `rate` can be of the following types: 
        1. `int` or `float`: a single discounted rate
        2. `tuple` of two elements: the first element is a list of maturities while 
        the second component is a list of interest rates
    
            
    `freq`  : frequency of payments per year. By default it is set to 4, 
              quarterly payments. 
    
    `t`  : time when the bond is evaluated
    
    `freq2`  : compounding frequency (by default is set to 0, which means 
            continuous discounting) \
    `option`  : contains the option of clean price or dirty price: \
              For the clean price it substracts the accrued coupon from the dirty
              price
    Examples
    --------
    1. Compute the price of a 2-year bond with a single yield rate of 6.76%,
    semi-annual coupons with annual coupon rate of 6%.

       Result: 98.38
    
    2. Compute the price of a 2-year bond with treasury rates 5%, 5.8%, 6.4% 
    and 6.8% corresponding to 6M, 12M, 18M and 24M if the coupon is 6% per year 
    and the payment frequency is twice/year.
